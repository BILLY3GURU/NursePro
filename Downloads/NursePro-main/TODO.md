# TODO: Connect Frontend to Backend

- [x] Create NursePro-main/backend/db.js: Export the MySQL pool from server.js.
- [x] Update NursePro-main/script.js: Add functions to fetch testimonials and services from http://localhost:3000/api/testimonials and /api/services, then update DOM.
- [x] Update NursePro-main/index.html: Remove hardcoded testimonials and services cards to allow dynamic population.
- [x] Fix field names in script.js (service.title instead of name, add rating display for testimonials).
- [x] Test: Run backend server (server running on port 3000, connected to DB). Frontend ready for testing - open index.html in browser to verify API fetches work.
